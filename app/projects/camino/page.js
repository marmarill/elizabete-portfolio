            <Paragraph> 
                Currently users can view the route on the Camino Latvija website. However, when on the go, the mobile format is definitely more convenient. Therefore, in collaboration with the organization itself, I developed a prototype for mobile app. Adding features such as: route planning and navigation, accommodation reservation, sights to see, option of communication with other like-minded travelers, weather etc..
